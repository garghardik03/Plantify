# Plantify

Welcome to the Plantify! This software utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms to detect and identify plants based on the input images provided by the users. It is designed to run on a website with several pages, including login, signup, home, upload, documentation, and about us.

## Features
- User Registration: Users can create an account by signing up with their credentials.
- User Authentication: Registered users can log in to the website securely.
- Home Page: Once logged in, users will be redirected to the home page, where they can access the main functionalities.
- Upload Image: Users can upload an image of a plant they want to identify.
- Plant Detection: The uploaded image is processed using CNN algorithms to detect and identify the plant species.
- Plant Name Display: The software will provide the name of the plant species detected in the uploaded image.
- Documentation: Users can access documentation or user guides for additional information on how to use the software effectively.
- About Us: This page provides information about the software, its development team, and any other relevant details.

## Installation
To run the backend, please follow the below steps: Install pipenv using pip install pipenv.

Now run the following commands:

pipenv run python -m app
The server should now be up and running on localhost:5100.

## Usage
1. Register a new account by navigating to the signup page and providing the required information.
2. Log in using your registered credentials on the login page.
3. After successful login, you will be redirected to the home page.
4. Upload an image of a plant that you want to identify using the provided upload functionality.
5. The software will process the image using CNN algorithms and display the detected plant species on the screen.
6. Explore the documentation page for more information on how to use the software and troubleshoot any issues.
7. If you have any questions or need support, visit the about us page for contact information.
